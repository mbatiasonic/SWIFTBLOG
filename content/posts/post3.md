There are nearly 80,000 mutual funds worldwide. Investors need a way to decide what investment is right for them. However, with so many metrics how do you decipher value? The answer isn’t buried in exhaustive investment guides. Instead, the winning strategy comes from a game show contestant in the 1980s.

In 1983 Michael Larson started recording episodes of a new game show called ‘Press Your Luck.’ Contestants hit their buzzer when they wanted to stop a chasing light circling a board. If they landed on the right square, they earned cash.

Larson noticed a flaw. The movement of the light across the board had only five patterns. He memorised all of them, flew to California and earned a spot on the show. His carefully timed gameplay landed him on the winning square every time. His ‘hack’ made him $110,237 in cash.

Investing is, of course, a more complicated game. However, the strange story of Larson offers a parallel to the stock market. Buried within the bells and whistles are a few key metrics. These numbers are the signals in the noise.

In this article, we’ll look at five key investing metrics. We’ll learn why they’re important and how to use them. Make smarter moves with just five numbers.
